To get the server up and running using Docker Compose, run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start up the server on port 3000. The port can be changed in the `docker-compose.yml` file.


**Troubleshooting**

On Windows, you may have an issue where, despite the docker-compose.yml file forwarding the port, your docker app
is not accessible from host. This appears to be a recent Docker For Windows limitation, which can be worked around by
installing a prior Docker version:

```
choco install docker-for-windows --version 17.09.1.14687
```
